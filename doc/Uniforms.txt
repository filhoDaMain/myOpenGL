"Common variable between CPU program and GPU shader so we can pass data between them"

1. On the .shader :

uniform vec4 u_Color;


2. On the CPU program:

    2.1 Get an ID for the uniform we wany to bind

    location = glGetUniformLocation(program, "u_Color") );


    2.2 Use the retrieved ID to access/update the uniform values

    /* In this example we are using a vec4 uniform */
    glUniform4f(location, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)
